# Minecraft Autofishing script

A script written in AutoHotkey which allows you to fish automatically. To be used in conjunction with one of those doohickeys which reels in the fishing hook when you've caught something (they're all over YouTube, pretty simple build if my memory serves me right)

The controls are in the top line of the code, they're also shown when you start the script.
